Raise your anchor  
Set your sail  
Come with me   
as we hunt this Whale  
The sea Is calling me  
The sea is calling me  

Look to your left   
Look to your right  
Everyone knows   
We’re not coming home tonight  

Raise your anchor   
Set your sail  
Come with me  
As we hunt this whale  
The Sea is calling me  
The Sea is calling me  

Grab you guns   
Grab your knives  
Not everyone is coming   
Home alive  

  
Raise your anchor   
Set your sail   
Come with me  
As we hunt this whale   
The sea is calling me  
The sea is calling me  

Hug your kids   
Kiss your wives  
We got a job to do  
It won’t be long this time  

The Sea is calling me  
The Sea is calling me  

Raise your anchor  
Set your sail  
Come with me   
As we hunt this whale  

The sea is calling me  
The sea is calling me  

Thrashing waves  
Crash and toil  
Amazing what  
We will do for oil   

The sea is calling me  
The sea is calling me  

I’ll play the strings  
Just like Nero   
Better believe   
I’m coming home a hero  

The sea is calling me  
The sea is calling me  

Now I’m a flag  
In a shadow box  
And nobody can judge me  
For the plank I choose to walk  

Raise your anchor   
Set your sail  
Come with me  
As we hunt this whale  

The sea is calling me  
The sea is calling me
