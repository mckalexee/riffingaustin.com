Sit down motherfucker  
let me show ya  
How to write a song

Take your main idea  
And save it for the end  
Delay that gratification  
Heard that from a good friend

Next part all you do  
Is find a thing that you wanna repeat  
When the verse comes to an end  
And then Change up the beat

Sit down motherfucker  
Let me show you how to write  
A song  
Sit down motherfucker  
Let me show you how to write  
a song

Move right in  
To verse two  
Verse 3 gets skipped  
When your sitting in a pew

Sit down motherfucker  
Let me show you how to  
Write a song

Don’t get mad  
Don’t get sore  
Just leave the good shit  
On lines one two and four

Sit down Motherfucker  
Let me show you  
How to write a song

Sit down Motherfucker  
Let me show you  
How to write a song

Some songs need a bridge  
I never really knew why  
Some songs need a bridge  
Not sure if I’m doing this right

***...Whatever***

Sit down motherfucker  
Let me show you  
How to write a song

Sit down motherfucker  
Let me show you  
How to write a song

This is that part  
Referenced at the beginning  
It’s the difference between  
Losing and winning  
The truth above truths is  
That the herds always thinning

Go on motherfucker  
How about you go  
And write a song

Go on motherfucker  
How about you go  
And write a song!!!
